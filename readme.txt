Removes the Project Custom Post Type from Divi theme.

== Description ==

This plugin simply removes the Project Custom Post Type, if you don't want to use it. You only need to activate the plugin and your Project menu is gone from your admin menu.

You have to buy the Divi Theme to use this plugin:
